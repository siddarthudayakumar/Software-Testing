# Software-Testing
Repo is going to contain stuff related to the software testing project. For now, it contains the code that I have cooked up for the project.
The repository contains a Lexicon Analyzer created with the help of Apache Lucene and a simple XML Parser for those long bug lists from the bug trackers.
I have also added the Project Proposal that was initially submitted and the progress report. 
Final reports and data recorded so far will be formatted into a more readable format and uploaded to the repository.
